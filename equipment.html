			<b>Yoga mats</b> are important for stretching. Yoga mats will prevent you from slipping in stretching poses. There are also certain stretches you would prefer doing on your own personal yoga mat rather than the floor. You can do pilates, floor exercises, and yoga. 
			</p>
					
		
	
	
	<p>
		<b>Resistance bands</b> can improve strength. They are pretty functional and can be used with various workouts. They are easy to use for beginners because you are working against the resistance band. There are difference resistance levels. It ranges from extra light-super heavy. These are a great option if you dont want to use weights.</p>
	
	<aside>
	<p>
		<b>Additional Information: </b></p><p>
			There are so many options when it comes to beginning a fitness routine. Most of the equipment can be used with very little weight or resistance. A keynote here is that if you are planning on using equipment of any kind and you have any restrictions, talk to a doctor or a professonal before beginning. Safety is just as important as your form. Take everything seriously and dont play around when you're trying to make an important decision for your life.

	<div class="right">
	
	<p><b>Treadmills</b> can introduce a wide range of inclines to your cardio workout. Adjusting the incline makes it like you are walking up a hill. You are able to adjust speed as well. Good form is also good to keep in mind even on a treadmill. Activating your core will allow for a better workout.</p>
	
	
	<p>	
			<b>Stairmaster</b> will work cardio, core, glutes and legs. If you have never done the stairmaster before, you can always hold the bars for balance. Always brace your core for stabilization and plant your foot fully on the step. This particular exercise will burn a good amount of calories. A 30-60 minute sessoin on the stairmaster can burn anywhere from 160-520 calories (depending on your weight and workout intensity).		
			</p>

<div class="bot-p">
	<p>	
		<b>Free weights & wearable weights </b> free weights are beneficial. Free weights can range between 1 lb. and up. There are so many exercises that use free weights. Another option is using the wearable weights that velcro together. There are different wearable weights - ankle, wrist, and weighted jackets. For the weighted jacket, you can add or take away weight to it.	</p>
		
		<p>
		<b>Stationary Bicycles</b> are easy to use because you are not fighting the elements. This is a low impact workout that is great for your cardiovascular system. You can start with a short interval session. Switching through low, medium & high intensity. 
			
		</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Kettlebells</b> are wonderful for full body workouts which reduce your workout time. When using kettlebells, it is a must that you use good form. They will give you a strong grip and a stonger body overall. The weight range is between 4-44kg. 
				
			</p>
</div>	
			<p>
			<b>Medicine Balls</b> are a fun addition to any workout routine. They don't bounce but you can throw them, catch them, and use them with a buddy. Depending on the weight they come in you can do alot of workouts. Wall throws, slams, chest presses, rebounder throws, and my personal favorite halos. There are many more exercises just to name a few.
			
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			<b>A stepper</b> is an underestimated piece of equipment. These are perfect for beginners to combine cardio with light weights or bands. It provides a low impact cardio workout on your joints. They can be stacked to give you an extra challenge.
			
			</p>
			
			<p>
			
			<p><b>Using gym equipment - </b>
			Now I'm sure everyone has an idea of why using equipment is beneficial. But I'm going to tell you why. With fixed machines you can find at the gym, they will control a the path of motion for the muscle that machine is meant to target. You are able to adjust the weight on the machine. So if you are interested in using stationary gym machines, you have the option to start with no weight added on and just increase it over time! If you are curious about equipment, normally there are many people willing to help you and gym employees around to help as well. Never be afraid to ask for assistance.

		<h2>Simple and Easy Beginner Workouts</h2>
				
				<p>Building muscle and increasing your strength does't require weights. Some of the easiest workouts are bodyweighted exercises and it doesn't require a gym membership. These type of exercises are very good for beginners because there is no extra stress added to your body. As explained on the home page, slow controlled movements are best. This prevents injuries and gives you the best workout. Using slow movements is excelent because the muscle is under tension. Meaning it's working harder. Form is the most important thing when starting out. Along with slow controlled movements, this will also help to prevent injuries. Having a proper form will help you make sure you are working on the muscle group you intend on working. You can watch yourself in a mirror and watch your form. It is very easy to forget your form when you are struggling with an exercise. Throughout your workout make sure to focus on the muscle you are working to get the full activation of the muscle. </p>

			<dt><h2>Reps vs Sets and how many should you do?<h2></dt>
			
			<dd> What are Reps? "Reps" are short for "repetition". Reps are the number of time you have completed 1 single exercise. For example, One squat is a rep and 12 squats are 12 reps.
			
			<p>What are sets? A set is a group of reps. For example, If your goal is to complete 30 squats during your workout section. You can break it down into 2 sets which would be 15 reps per set.</p>
			
			<p>The basic standard of reps to sets is 10-12 reps to 3 sets. Almost always this basic standard will be enough for a very good workout even for the advanced people. If you dont feel like its enough, you can always start with a light weight and work your way up.</p>

			<dt><h2>Proper forms and modifications for the above exercises.</h2></dt>
			
				<dd><b>Squats:</b>
				
				<p><b>Instruction -</b> Stand with feet a little wider than hip-width and toes facing forward.
				Drive your hips back, bending at the knees and
				Sit into a squat position while keeping your heels and toes planted firmly on the ground. Your knees should push out slightly. Keep your chest up and shoulders back. Press into your heels and straighten legs to return to a standing position.</p>
				
				<p><b>Tips:</b>Over time, try to get your thighs parallel to the floor, meaning knees are bent to a 90-degree angle. To make this easier for you, place a chair behind you or get a fitness ball and place it between your back and a wall until you are able to do squats without breaking your form.

			<dd><b>Kneeling Push-ups:</b></dd>
			
			<p><b>Instruction -</b> Kneel on the floor (you may need some padding under your knees).
			Extend arms and put hands shoulder-width apart on the floor in front of you.
			Tighten your core (abs) while lowering your torso by bending your arms until your chest grazes the floor.
			Push your torso back up by straightening your arms.</p>
			
			<p><b>Tips:</b>  Keep your back straight and don't round it (Doing this will break your form).
			Push your weight into your whole hand and fingers to avoid straining your wrist.
			If you notice your form is becoming sloppy. Stop and take a break for 30-60 seconds. This exercise is already a modification of the push-up.

	<dl>
		<dd><b>Lunges</b></dd>
			<p><b>Instruction -</b> With feet shoulder-width apart, make sure you keep your back straight. Step forward far enough to allow for the 90 degree bend in your front leg. Engage your glutes (squeezing them together) and engage your core. Do not twist your body in anyway. You should be able to see your foot throughout the exercise. Your back knee should be aligned with your hip. Your Push through your heel to come back to a standing position.  </p>
			
			
			<p><b>Tips: </b>If you cannot go to the full 90 degree in the front leg, just dont go down as far. You can use a chair or wall to assist you as you lower yourself. If stepping forward is to difficult to maintain your form stay in the spread leg position (see picture for example.</b>  </p>  
			
			</dl>
			
		<dl>
			<dd><b>Plank</b></dd>
			
				<p><b>Instructions -</b> Plant your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Your toes will be pushed into the floor. Activate your glutes and core and keep your body in a straight alignment. Your neck should be aligned with your back. 
				</p>
				
			<p><b>Tips: </b> If the plank is to hard you can modify it by dropping onto your elbows so your whole forearm is on the floor. you can put your palms flat on the forr or clasp your hands together. another modification for this exercise is dropping to your knees with arms extended (see picture for example). doing this variartion will reduce stress on your lower back. Make sure to pull your belly button in - This will help your form</p>

			<p><b>Tips: </b> If you do not have light dumbbells, you can use a small water bottle filled with any substance you'd like. Just make sure the weights are equal. To make this exercies easier, you can do this without the weights and add more reps. </p>
		</dl>
		
		<dl>
			<dd><b>Jumping Jacks</b></dd>

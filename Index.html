				<h2>What is beginner fitness?</h2>
				
					<p>Beginner fitness will teach you the basics of what you need to know. Listening to your body, days a week to train, equipment you should start with/ avoid, what kind of clothing/shoes to wear, beginner level workouts, some nutrition information, and what kind of supplements you can take (optional).</p>
				<br>
			
	<dl>
		<dt><h2>Why you should highly consider starting your fitness & health journey.</h2></dt> 
		
			<dd> Starting a workout routine can be beneficial for your health. The smallest changes can make big changes over time. Whichever your reasons for considering or starting this jouney. Doing these small changes will make you into a healthier person. Regardless if it's more workout based or focused toward the nutritional aspect. An overall health goal will lengthen your life and make you feel better than you currently are. Exercising boosts energy levels as well as changing your eating habits. Following a routine helps to distract the mind from mindless unhealthy activities such as snacking or binge eating.</dd>
		</dl>

			
		<dl>
			<dt><h2>Why are you doing this?</h2></dt>
			
			<dd>There may be tons of reasons why you would be wanting to better your life. Some of the main reasons are to look good in your clothing, you're tired of being overweight, medical reasons, or just wanting to live longer for your grandchildren. Whatever the reason, you are on your way to changing your life. Make your reason your motivation to get you to your end goal. Having a very good reason will rocket your motivation and make it feel less of a job or a daunting task.</dd>
		</dl>
			
			
		<dl>
			<dt><h2> What is the importance of having a steady workout/nutrition routine? <h2></dt>
			
			<dd>Once you get into a routine, the easier it is to plan things around your newly developed habits. Sometimes it is not a walk in the park. There will be difficulties along the way. It can be difficult to start for some but if you are adament about reaching your goal you can over come your personal hurdles. When you get into the groove of your routine, you can track how your body is reacting to the foods you are eating or the workouts you are doing. It will be  easier to pinpoint where you can make adjustments in your routine or nutrition decisions versus not knowing why. Again, making small adjustments will lead to a more successful you. </dd>
		</dl>
			
		
		<dl>
			<dt><h2>How quickly should you progress?<h2></dt>
			
			<dd>Starting at a very slow pace will lessen the liklihood of quitting early on in your journey. So start SLOW. All of your movements should be controlled and slow. Before working out and cooling down, please take the time to warm up and stretch. This is very important for muscle repair, flexibility, and to prevent injuries. Eventually you can speed up your routines slightly. Workingout mindlessly and quickly does not reap the maximum benefits of your workout. During your workouts, you will want to focus on the muscle you are working. Focusing on the muscle you are working will make sure you are activing that muscle giving you a better chance of a better workout. Overall, your journey will be long so don't get discouraged if you hit a plateu. There is no "Quick Fix" when it comes to losing weight or getting into shape.</dd>

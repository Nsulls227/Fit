		<p>The hardest part of working out is the days after. When you are sore and hurting. No one likes the feeling, but that feeling means that your muscles are repairing themselves. They are becoming stronger than they were. So bare with the pain for a while. Stretching will help with some of the pain. You are stronger than you believe. Keep in your mind why you are doing this. I tell myself, "I am doing this to be stronger, healthier, and happier." For me, it works. It resets my mindset of where I am going and who I used to be, isn't who I want to bring with to my new future. Look forward and don't look back. Find your self motivation saying and don't stop. Progress takes a very long time. If you stick with it your outcome will be your grand prize.</p>
